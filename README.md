## Microcontroller Embedded C Programming: Absolute Beginners

This repo contains notes and programming assignments for the Udemy's "[Microcontroller Embedded C Programming: Absolute Beginners](https://www.udemy.com/course/microcontroller-embedded-c-programming/)" course by FastBit Embedded Brain Academy.

Date: October, 2022.

- The course is instructed by Engineer Kiran Nayak.

- The [**Certificate**](https://github.com/renatosoriano/Coursera-Introduction-to-Embedded-Systems-Software-and-Development-Environments/blob/master/Certificate.pdf) is available. 

## Descriptions

This course is mainly targeted for absolute beginners to learn microcontroller programming using the 'C ' programming language.
Some of the critical microcontroller-related 'C' concepts discussed with clear examples and writing code for the target embedded board are:

1. Importance of bitwise operators.
2. Usage of bit manipulation techniques to program MCU peripheral registers.
3. Accessing memory-mapped registers using pointers.
4. Pointers and casting.
5. Structures, bitfields, unions, and bit extraction techniques.
6. Representing hardware registers details and configuring them using 'C' structure definitions.
7. Usage of const and volatile type qualifiers.
8. Interpret complex variable definitions involving the combination of const and volatile.
9. The precise usage of const pointers, const data, volatile const, with pointer and non-pointer variables.
10. The behavior of the code during compiler optimization and solution using volatile.
11. Functions and friends.
12. Data types, variables definitions, storage class specifiers and much more.
13. Loops: while, for, do. while.
14. MCU internal architecture and programming peripherals.
15. Interfacing projects.

## Requirements

**[STM32 NUCLEO-F446RE development board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f446re.html#overview)** - Board used in this course but any board with Arm Cortex-M0/3/4 core will work, just modifying the target board and configuring with the respective datasheet. \
**[Eclipse-based STM32CubeIDE](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html)** - C/C++ development platform with peripheral configuration, code generation, code compilation, and debug features for STM32 microcontrollers and microprocessors. Works on Windows/Linux/Mac and is free.
